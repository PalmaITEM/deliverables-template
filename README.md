This template was adapted from the netCommons project template [ðŸ”—](http://www.netcommons.eu).

## Usage

The file **main.tex** should be your master document, where you can include/remove chapters in your document.

You should also edit the file **title.tex** for defining deliverable specific options. In particular:

1. the deliverable title (`\newcommand{\DelTitle}{Title of this deliverable}`)
2. the deliverable number  (`\newcommand{\DelNumber}{DX.X}`)
3. and, the deliverable version (`\newcommand{\DelVersion}{0.X/1.0}`)

The project logo in the footer can be changed by editing the following line:

```
\newcommand{\footerlogo}{\raisebox{3mm}{\leavevmode\includegraphics[width=2cm]{SINet}}}
```
