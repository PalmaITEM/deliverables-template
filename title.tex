\section*{Abstract}
Provide a short description, highlight the topics considered in the deliverable.

The abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of the full deliverable.

The abstract must be between 150-250 words. Be sure that you adhere to these limits.

The abstract must be written as one paragraph, and should not contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material.

The abstract should include three or four different keywords or phrases, as this will help readers to find it. It is important to avoid over-repetition of such phrases as this can result in a page being rejected by search engines.

Ensure that your abstract reads well and is grammatically correct.
